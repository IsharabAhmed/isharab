          My journey in technology began with a fascination for creating intelligent systems. As a core developer for Voice Subnet 16 and Music Subnet 50 on the Bittensor network, I dove deep into AI, using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch to solve complex problems. This experience honed my analytical foundation. On the side, as a hobby, I dabbled in mobile development with Flutter, which taught me valuable lessons in user-centric design.

          This innate curiosity has now led me to a new frontier: cybersecurity. I believe that understanding how to build complex systems provides a unique advantage in learning how to break themâ€”and, more importantly, how to secure them. My focus is now intensely on bug bounty hunting and web application security. Every day is a new challenge, whether I'm dissecting CWEs on Hack The Box or climbing the ranks on PortSwigger's Web Security Academy.

          This portfolio documents my evolution. I'm channeling the tenacity and analytical rigor from my AI background into the world of ethical hacking. My ambition is to become a top-tier security researcher, contribute to a safer internet, and pursue advanced certifications like OSWE and OSEE. I'm not just changing careers; I'm evolving my craft.
